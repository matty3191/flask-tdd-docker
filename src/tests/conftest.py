## Fixtures are reusable objects for tests. They have a scope associated with them, which indicates how often the fixture is invoked:

# function - once per test function (default)
# class - once per test class
# module - once per test module
# session - once per test session

# In essence, all code before the yield statement serves as setup code while everything after serves as the teardown.
