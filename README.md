# flask-tdd-docker
A follow along course project using a TDD approach to build, test and deploy a production-grade microservice powered by Python, Flask, and Docker 

Whilst attending an intensive data engineering bootcamp run by Generation and Infinity Works I found this separate course delivered by testdrive.io that covers a lot of 
technical content touched upon in the bootcamp. Therefore I am following along to gain better understanding and familiarity with the technologies used in bootcamp.
By the end of this mini-course, I hope to be more proficient with the use of Python, Flask, Flask-restx, Docker, TDD, Postrgres, and PyTest
